# Black-Jack-Game
Python run blackjack game
A simple black jack game where the user plays against the dealer. The program deals a 2 cards from a 
randomized stack of cards to both dealer and player. Object of the game is to be as close to the count
of 21 as possible, without going over or "busting." Program recognizes Ace card is worth 11 when paired
with a face card else it is worth 1. Numeric cards reflect their own point worth and face cards represent
a value of 10. There is an added betting function where the player starts with a bank of 1000 and can bet 
varying amounts. After each round, the player can see the hidden card the dealer was dealt. Dealer never
hits. When the player runs out of money the game ends.
